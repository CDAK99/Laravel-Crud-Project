# Laravel CRUD Project
This repository contains a Laravel program that allows you to create, read, update & delete records in a SQL database table. This is done by using jQuery & Ajax to send the data to the backend where it is then processed and a message is sent back. The DB table has been setup using migrations and the frontend has been made using HTML, CSS & jQuery. The program will also use validation to ensure that the data being entered is valid. This is done using both Laravel & jQuery.

I hope this repository is useful to you and demonstrates my abilities as both a Laravel & jQuery developer.

Thanks, Callum.
